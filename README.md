# hello-world
I'm 29 years old and work as an IT Technician at Boston Metal, a metal production company where I get to see the fascinating blend of traditional industry and modern technology. It's incredible being part of an industry that's been around for thousands of years, yet relies so heavily on the digital infrastructure I help maintain.

While working full-time, I'm also pursuing my master's degree in data science. It's challenging juggling both.
